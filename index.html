                    In the era of technological advancements, the automotive industry has witnessed a transformative shift towards autonomous driving solutions. Our project endeavors to contribute to this evolution by developing a self-driving car equipped with an intelligent automatic parking system. This innovative system aims to autonomously navigate the vehicle into parking spaces, utilizing real-time data from sensors, cameras, and advanced computing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Automatic parking, a hallmark of autonomous vehicle maneuvering, encompasses the seamless transition of a car from a traffic lane to a parking spot, embracing various configurations such as parallel, perpendicular, or angled parking. The proposed system prioritizes not only efficient parking but also ensures adaptability to dynamic environments by employing sensor-based obstacle detection.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the event of obstacles obstructing the vehicle's path, our self-driving car will dynamically alter its course, avoiding collisions and ensuring safe navigation within the parking area. To enhance the overall functionality, crucial information such as the departure and arrival of the vehicle will be systematically recorded in a database, offering insights into usage patterns and optimizing operational efficiency.
                </p>
                <p>
                    An integral feature of our system is its ability to notify users when parking slots are occupied, displaying a message indicating that the parking space is full. This real-time feedback contributes to an enhanced user experience and facilitates better management of parking resources.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The heart of our project lies in the integration of cutting-edge technologies, including computer vision, sensors, and mechanical components. This amalgamation enables our self-driving car to execute complex parking maneuvers with precision and speed. The implementation of turntables further streamlines the departure process, eliminating the need for drivers to engage in manual reverse maneuvers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As we delve into the details of this project, our aim is not only to create a miniature self-driving car with automatic parking capabilities but also to contribute to the broader discourse on the integration of autonomous systems in large, multi-story or multi-level parking facilities.
